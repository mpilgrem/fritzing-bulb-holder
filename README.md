# fritzing-bulb-holder

## Introduction

The [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) software tool allows users to document
their electronics prototypes. However, as at version 0.9.2b, the library of
parts included with the software does not include an incandescent light bulb.

Users can import their own parts. This project seeks to add the following parts:

* bulb_holder_E10_with_base: a holder for an E10 light bulb with a black base.
